**PhD Candidate**

**Center for Pervasive Communications and Computing (CPCC) at the University of California, Irvine**

Originally, I am from Sant Cugat (near Barcelona) but I've lived in Pasadena, Irvine (now), as well as Madison, WI.

My doctoral advisor is [Hamid Jafarkhani](https://www.ece.uci.edu/~hamidj/), and I have previously been at NASA's JPL with [Marc Sanchez-Net](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0C0EdK8AAAAJ&hl=en) and at the Vector Institute with [Xiaoxiao Li](https://xxlya.github.io/).

# Research interests

My research is focused on making distributed algorithms work in communication-constrained networks, with an emphasis on privacy-preserving Machine Learning. I derive theoretical bounds and demonstrate my results with practical implementations. This includes algorithms for Federated Learning and Decentralized Control.

More broadly, I am interested in optimization, information theory and AI.

### Truly decentralized learning on directed graphs

Decentralized optimization algorithms typically require communication between nodes to be bi-directional. 

In the directed case, existing algorithms required nodes to know how many listeners they have (knowledge of their out-degree). We proposed a [series of works](https://github.com/TomasOrtega/DT-GO) that circumvent this requirement.

Currently, I'm interested in incorporating more aspects of real networks to bridge the gap between the practice and theory of decentralized learning.

### Proving stuff with Lean

On the side, I'm learning about theorem proving with Lean. In the future I would like to formalize more of my proofs using Lean, so far I have only done some [tests](https://github.com/TomasOrtega/test_dtgo).
